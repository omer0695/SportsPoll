JavaScript ES6

## Completed Steps
- Created component Poll/Poll.js where users can cast their vote and then results are shown from local storage based on previous votes.
- Project data is kept in data/test-assignment.json file 
- Project design and theme
* I had to spend some time looking for a suitable theme for the project and the images and the best way to present the data. 
* For each particular event the country flag, sports ball icon, sports bacckground image is shown and can also be seen as a title on mouseover on the images.
* Sport status is shown as an LED light and if match is progress, LIVE icon is shown.
* CSS animations for ball spin and Votes results
* 3 vote types are kept in a file called VoteTypes.js to avoid typos



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
