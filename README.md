# Solution by Omer Saleem - Senior Frontend Developer

## Technology Stack
The app is created using latest version of React. Built in React state management and hooks are used.
JavaScript ES6.
(Its a simple project so did not use Redux)

## Installation 
Create clone of the repository and then use command 'npm install' followed by 'npm start' inside root folder to start the app.
The terminal will show both local and network URL (to test the app on mobile device).

## Completed Steps
- Created first component Poll/Poll.js where users can cast their vote view poll results.
- React state management is used along with Browser's local storage based on previous votes.
- Project data is read from data/test-assignment.json file.
- Project design and theme is created for sports:
* I had to spend some time looking for a suitable theme for the project and the suitable images and the best way to present the data. Perhaps this was the most time consuming step.
* For each particular event the country flag, sports ball icon, sports background image is shown and can also be seen as a title on mouseover on the images.
* Sport status is shown as an LED light and if match is progress, LIVE icon is shown.
* CSS animations for ball spin and Votes results.
* 3 vote types are kept in a file called VoteTypes.js to avoid typos.
* CSS3 media queries are added to support mobile devices screens.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
